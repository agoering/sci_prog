hw4 info:

Data file quake.txt contains 6 cols of info:
Col 1: technique descriptor - extraneous
Col 2: year
Col 3,4: lat,long
Col 5: depth under surface; 0 indicates no data
Col 6: richter scale magnitude of quake

TODO: Produce 5 products from data, as team if want to:

1. Event counter: user enters the following
	(latitude, longitude, begin year, end year, magnitude threshold)
	Counter returns values
	No GUI interface needed
	Sample output: earthquake occurrences within radius of 100miles
			from Seattle.
2. Clustering detection algorithm:
	cluster events at nearly same lat,long,time
	output table of clustered events
	try to represent clustering visually
3. Use D3 Gallery to plot (lat,long) of events within longitude:[-75:-150]
4. Use D3 Gallery to make timeline of events > 7.5 magnitude
5. Use "happy" multiple axis graph, set up with following for X or Y:
	-longitude, depth, magnitude, year
