Column C: Year
Column D: Temperature in F

1. Program: Calculate standard deviation of temperature from arbitrary beginning year and ending year input by user. 

2. Calibrate: report standard deviations for the years 1930 to 1960 and 1980 to 2010. 

3. Plot: temperature averaged in 10 year increments and standard deviation in 10 year increments. Temp data = red, stddev data = blue.

4. Submit as a single PDF via email by 10pm
