hw3 To Do

Understand the file format:
Column 1 is Storm ID
Column 2 is name of storm
Column 3,4 is lat/long
Column 5/6 is wind speed and central pressure
Column 7 is year
Column 8 is some running date field in units of hours.
Column 9 is a descriptor

What options are in descriptor field? Need to identify hurricane events.

Read/write to paste into Google Code with following format:
Col 0: Decade, begin 1920 end 2010. String, number, date, datetime ok
Col 1-n: number of hurricanes in pressure bins: number only

Syntax required for input to Google Code:
       [['str','str','str',...,'str']
	['str',#,#,#,...,#],
	[...],
	[...],
	[...]]
 
Program determines:
 - frequency of hurricane events
 - min(central pressure) for each hurricane event

1. (DONE) Isolate hurricanes only
2. Isolate distinct storms by decade
3. Calculate min central pressure for each distinct storm
4. Define pressure bins
5. Count frequency of hurricanes, filter by pressure bins
